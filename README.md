Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) which can retain important information over time using memory cells.  This property of LSTMs makes it a wonderful algorithm to learn sequences that are interdependent and can help to build solutions like language translation, sales time series, chatbots, autocorrections, next word suggestions, etc.In this case study, I will show how LSTMs can be used to learn the patterns in the stock prices. Using this template you will be able to predict tomorrowâ€™s price of a stock based on the last 10 days prices.
